Intake
======

Welcome to the [Project Seldon][1] intake repository!

Use this repo to submit ideas, bug reports, questions and any other type of feedback. We'll
categorize and prioritize these notes by looking for patterns where many users are affected,
and -- with that in mind -- we'd love for you search through other feedback that's been
submitted as well. React with an emoji if you like or dislike an idea, help us flesh out use
cases for the product and shape new features. Any thoughts, positive or negative, are welcome
as long as you keep the discourse constructive and respect other members of our community.

As of right now, you do need to make a GitHub account in order to submit feedback. At some
point we'll aim to integrate more of this functionality into the site itself but for the
time being we're focusing on delivering more data and research functionality.

We'd love to have you join us on Slack as well, reach out and we'll send you an invite to
our workspace...
