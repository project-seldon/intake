Intake
======

Welcome to the [Project Seldon][1] intake repository!

Use this repo to submit ideas, bug reports, questions and any other type. We'll categorize
and prioritize these various types of feedback by looking for patterns where many users
are affected.

As of right now, you do need to make a GitHub account in order to submit feedback. At some
point we'll aim to integrate more of this functionality into the site itself but for the
time being we're focusing on delivering more data and research functionality.

We'd love to have you join us on Slack as well, reach out and we'll send you an invite to
our workspace...
